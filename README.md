## laptop price prediction using machine learning


In this project i  have to predict the price of different laptops using the given data sets.


-Data set used- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price

For the analysis, we will use Python in its latest version. We'll use pandas, numpy and re packages for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

The database contains 1303 rows and 13 variables. Each line corresponds to one laptop and the columns describe its components such as the company producing the hardware, product name, device type, screen size in inches, screen resolution, CPU, RAM, Memory, GPU, operating system, hardware weight and price. Data doesn't contain gaps but will require preparation for modeling (e.g. format change, recoding, removal of unnecessary variables). We start with data exploration, checking the price in turn depending on each feature of the laptop.
